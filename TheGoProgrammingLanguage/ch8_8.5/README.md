* With the [gitlab_interview](./gitlab_interview/), I was provided a Merge Request with add-concurrency changes to master, and told to improve it. [my_improvements](./gitlab_interview/interview-task-161848681002-my-improvements/) are my improvements which use the [Looping in Parallel pattern](../../LearningGo-AnIdiomaticApproachToRealWorldGoProgramming/README.md#looping-in-parallel) from The Go Programming Language book, as seen on pg 238
